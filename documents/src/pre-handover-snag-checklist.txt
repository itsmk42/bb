Purpose:
Final stage checklist before handover to family/client.

Checks before handover:
1. Room-wise wall and ceiling finish inspection under full lighting.
2. Doors and windows open/close smoothly without rubbing.
3. All plumbing points tested for leakage and drainage flow.
4. Electrical points and MCB labeling verified.
5. Floor level and tile hollow sound checks completed.
6. Waterproofing sensitive zones inspected for damp marks.
7. Stair railing, balcony safety, and edge protection confirmed.
8. O&M handover file prepared (drawings, warranties, contacts).

Practical note:
Close all snags with dated photos and sign-off to avoid post-occupancy disputes.
