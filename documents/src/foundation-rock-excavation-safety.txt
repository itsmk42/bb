Updated: 2026-02-24

Purpose:
Site checklist for controlled rock breaking methods used near residential neighborhoods.

Safety and execution checks:
1. Mark utility lines and adjacent structures before drilling.
2. Confirm drilling depth, spacing, and pattern as per engineer instruction.
3. Use correct powder ratio and mixing process.
4. Keep crew at safe distance during reaction period.
5. Mandatory PPE: gloves, eye protection, safety shoes.
6. Secure access zone and keep children/public away.
7. Inspect surrounding walls and slabs for cracks before and after operation.
8. Dispose debris systematically and keep excavation depth controlled.

Practical note:
Controlled methods reduce vibration risk compared to conventional blasting in dense residential areas.
