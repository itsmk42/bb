Updated: 2026-02-24

Purpose:
A practical guide for comfortable and durable kitchen planning.

Core checks:
1. Platform height selected based on primary user comfort.
2. Platform width supports safe cutting, washing, and stove spacing.
3. Sink, stove, and work triangle set for efficient movement.
4. Electrical points and chimney route planned before civil closure.
5. Water inlet/outlet points coordinated with modular layout.
6. Avoid sharp corner conflicts in daily movement path.

Practical note:
Direction can matter culturally, but wrong platform dimensions create daily physical strain.
