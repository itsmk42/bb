  "bioParagraph": "I grew up in a small village near Kukke Subrahmanya at the foothills of the Western Ghats. In our village, whenever someone started to build a house or community spaces like temples, it was our practice to step in and help according to our capacity. I was part of many such efforts within our own family and community. That is where my real learning began on the ground, understanding construction with my own hands. Later, I completed my B.Tech in Civil Engineering, but my heart has always stayed connected to the site. Over the years, I have built deep expertise in residential construction.",
  "introParagraph": "When I began sharing my knowledge on social media, inquiries grew. Even then, I have never believed in taking projects just to increase numbers. I work only where our expertise can genuinely help the family, and we approach every home as if it were our own. Today, I run a small firm based in Sahakar Nagar, Bengaluru, supported by a strong team that shares the same empathy and values I believe in. Together, we keep the entire journey practical, transparent, and genuinely caring so you never feel alone in the process.",
